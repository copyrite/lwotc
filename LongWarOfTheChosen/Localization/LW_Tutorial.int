CampaignStartTitle="Welcome to Long War of the Chosen"
CampaignStartBody="LWOTC is a complete overhaul to XCOM 2 WOTC that makes the campaign more challenging and feel like a guerrilla war.<br/><br/>You can disable this tutorial via Change Difficulty > Advanced Options in the game menu."

[X2EventListener_Tutorial]
DroneSightedTitle="New Enemy: Drone"
DroneSightedBody="ADVENT Drones are hardy robotic scouts with high detection range and crowd control weapons. They are often found patrolling alone and can appear inside buildings and on rooftops."
RainbowTrooperSightedTitle="New Enemies: ADVENT Infantry"
RainbowTrooperSightedBody="ADVENT now fields a variety of infantry units in addition to the basic trooper:<ul><li>Sentries (blue) specialize in overwatch</li><li>Gunners (green) sport a high-damage cannon with suppression capabilities</li><li>Grenadiers (red) use a grenade launcher for crowd control and damage</li><li>Rocketeers (orange) fire high-accuracy rockets</li></ul>"
HavenHighlightTitle="Review your haven"

FirstMissionDiscoveredTitle="First Mission Discovered"
FirstMissionDiscoveredBody="You have detected your first mission! Your next step is to assign a squad to infiltrate it.<br/><br/>Most missions have an expiry date and infiltration takes time. Improve your odds for reaching 100% infiltration by putting more rebels on the intel job. Scanning at a haven with the Avenger will contribute 4 rebels-worth of intel."
FirstRetaliationTitle="ADVENT Retaliations"
FirstRetaliationBody="ADVENT are retaliating! These are quick-response missions that you should not ignore.<br/><br/>There is a full retaliation, which if ignored or lost destroys the haven, and job-specific retaliations that will kill the rebels on that job if ignored. Your haven adviser will be available on the mission along with some rebels."
CommandersQuartersEnteredTitle="LWOTC Help"
CommandersQuartersEnteredBody="LWOTC adds several entries to the XCOM Archives that explain some of its core concepts in more detail, like infiltration and haven management.<br/><br/>You can also review all your havens from one screen via the Resistance Management menu."

GeneralChosenTitle="The Chosen"
GeneralChosenBody="A Chosen will appear on this mission. In LWOTC, they respond to XCOM activity by taking part only in retaliations (intel, supply, recruit, full, and invasion). They will not appear on other missions.<br/><br/>Their goal is still to gain knowledge about the location of the Avenger and assault it. Beware, defending against it will not be easy!"

TacticalChosenTitle="The Chosen in Battle"
TacticalChosenBody="The Chosen are far more dangerous in person in LWOTC:<br/><ul><li>They are near immune to critical hits</li><li>They take an action (\"prime reaction\") every time XCOM damages them during XCOM's turn</li><li>They can kidnap bleeding-out soldiers at range, at the cost of a full turn</li><li>They gain significant strengths on level up (use F1 when targeting them for detailed information)</li></ul>"

AssassinSightedTitle="The Assassin"
AssassinSightedBody="The Assassin drastically reduces incoming damage once she has taken enough damage each turn. While her Sword and Harbor Wave damage start low, they will increase in power as she uses them until she captures a soldier.<br/><br/>Be careful with unit placement, as she can use her prime reaction to slash an adjacent soldier."

WarlockSightedTitle="The Warlock"
WarlockSightedBody="The Warlock chooses one of his allies as his Greatest Champion. While that ally remains alive, the Warlock will take significantly less damage. Prepare to deal with his spectral summons, and be wary of his Mind Scorch, which applies burning in an area around a target.<br/><br/>HINT: LWOTC soldiers have Stock Strike for pinning down their Mind Controlled allies!"

HunterSightedTitle="The Hunter"
HunterSightedBody="The Hunter will keep his distance and try to pick off soldiers from a safe position. He can start his turn with a free sniper rifle shot at a flanked target. Be careful as you approach: his pistol shot will now disable XCOM weapons and he can throw his flashbangs as a free action."

HavenManagementTitle="Haven Management"
HavenManagementBody="Havens are home to a collection of rebels who can undertake several jobs:<br/><ul><li>Intel - detects missions</li><li>Recruit - recruits rebels and rookies</li><li>Supply - generates supplies</li></ul><br/>The more rebels that are on a job, the more you get from it. Keep your rebels on Intel for now."

HavenAdvisersTitle="Haven Advisers"
HavenAdvisersBody="Click on the box labeled (1) on the left to assign an adviser to the haven. You can assign one of:<br/><ul><li>Soldier - detects Faceless and helps recruit</li><li>Scientist - improves Intel job output, but no longer contributes to research</li><li>Engineer - improves Supply job output</li></ul><br/>Detecting Faceless allows you to evict them."

[UIScreenListener_CovertActionsTutorial]
CovertActionsTutorialTitle="Covert Actions"
CovertActionsTutorialBody="Unlike vanilla WOTC, your operatives can fail covert actions. The risk of failure is reduced based on the ranks of the soldiers on the operation. The higher the ranks, the lower the risk of failure.<br/><br/>Also, the risk of ambush increases the more covert actions are completed without being ambushed. Risk is reset once one is ambushed."

[UIScreenListener_MissionBriefTutorial]
MissionBriefTutorialTitle="Mission Briefings"
MissionBriefTutorialBody="Mission expiration determines how long you have to infiltrate the mission. The more mission intel you generate from the rebel Intel job, the earlier you detect missions and the longer you have to infiltrate.<br/><br/>You don't have to do every mission, but you should do as many as you can. If you don't have a squad or don't have enough time, then don't be afraid to skip a mission."
MissionEnemyCountTitle="Enemy numbers"
MissionEnemyCountBody="The enemy count shown on the left is an approximation of how many enemies will be on the mission if you reach 100% infiltration.<br/><br/>Underinfiltrating (not reaching 100%) results in more enemies on the mission. Overinfiltrating has a chance to reduce the enemy numbers."

[UIScreenListener_SquadSelectTutorial]
SquadSelectInfiltrationTitle="Choosing Squads"
SquadSelectInfiltrationBody="In addition to choosing squad members that are strong enough for the mission, you also need to take into account infiltration time in LWOTC.<br/><br/>Each extra squad member increases infiltration time exponentially beyond the fourth one. Abilities like Tradecraft and items like Suppressors can reduce infiltration time a little."

[UIScreenListener_InfiltratingMissionTutorial]
InfiltratingMissionTitle="Infiltrating Missions"
InfiltratingMissionBody="You can launch an infiltration mission at any time, but underinfiltrating makes missions harder. You can spend Intel to boost the infiltration so it completes faster.<br/><br/>You can abort the infiltration at any time and restart it later if the mission hasn't expired yet. Restarting sets infiltration back to 0%."
